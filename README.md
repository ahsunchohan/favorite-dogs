# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Question Statement

FE SWE Homework assignment
Webapp - 'favorite dogs'

Create a React webapp that will present a gallery of 6 random dog images from https://random.dog/woof.json. Allow user to choose one (or
more) to favorite (use local storage).

If user doesnâ€™t like any of the six, use a refresh/next button to get 6 more. Repeat.

There should be two endpoints.
- / - described above
- /favorites - displays all the favorite dogs

Consider making the screen a flexbox so that it arranges itself correctly for mobile screens.
